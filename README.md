# Consensus Voting Contract

This Solidity smart contract facilitates consensus voting among participants. With its implementation, users can engage in a voting process where decisions are collectively made based on the consensus reached by the voters.

## Getting Started

To deploy and interact with the contract, you'll need to set up a development environment and install dependencies.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14.x or later)
- npm (Node.js package manager)
- Hardhat

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone [<repository_url>](https://github.com/Signor1/consensus-voting-contract.git)
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd consensus-voting-contract
```

3. Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

4. Compile the contracts:

```
npx hardhat compile
```

5. Deploy the contracts to a local Hardhat network:

```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

## Usage

Once the contract is deployed, users can interact with it through various functions.


## Testing

Unit tests are included to ensure the functionality of the contract.

1. Run the unit tests:

```
npx hardhat test
```
